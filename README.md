Code Louisville Software Dev2 Proj

This is my project for the May Software Development Level 2 cohort. It is a Fantasy Football Team MVC/ASP. Net project that allows you to create a personalized roster of your favorite NFL players that can displayed in a list for comparison. 

The special instruction/system requirements are as follows:

1. My application needs to be accessed on a PC or Mac that has Visual Studio Code installed.
2. My repository can be cloned via Github at https://github.com/FCLAY1977/Fantasy-Ballers.git
3. The MVC can be run at the terminal level using the dotnet run command.
4. You can then click and press ctrl on one of the http links under the info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime line 
   to access the MVC.

The requirements for this project I believe I have met are listed below: 

I created at least one class, then created at least one object of that class and populate it with data. I use and display the data in my application. 
 

I’ve created and called at least 3 functions or methods, at least one returns a value that is used in my application. 

 

I have implemented a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program. 

 

I have created an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent. 

 

I have created a dictionary or list, populated it with several values, retrieved at least one value, and used it in my program. 
 
 
I have created a program that can read data from an external JSON file to utilize that data in my application.


I have used a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure (such as a list or array) or file.
