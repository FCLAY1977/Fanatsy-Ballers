This is my project for the May Software Development Level 2 cohort. It is Fantasy Football Team MVC/ASP. Net project that allows you to create a personalized roster of your favorite NFL players that can displayed in a list for comparison. 

The special instruction/system requirements to use my application are that it needs to be accessed on a PC or Mac that has Visual Studio Code installed.  

 

The requirements for this project I believe I have met are listed below: 

I created at least one class, then created at least one object of that class and populate it with data. I use and display the data in my application. 
 

I’ve created and called at least 3 functions or methods, at least one returns a value that is used in my application. 

 

I have implemented a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program. 

 

I have created an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent. 

 

I have created a dictionary or list, populated it with several values, retrieved at least one value, and used it in my program. 
 
 
I have created a program that can read data from an external JSON file to utilize that data in my application.
